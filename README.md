# DSA-notes

##What is DSA?
Data Structure Algorithm is to simply place and store data in an organized manner.
For example: Array
We can store data in Data Array, Stack, Queue are type of data structure where we can store data so that we can use it for particular purpose. 

##Types of Data Structure
Primitive- int, flow 
Non-Primitive- Array, Stack, Queue

##Why do you need to learn Data Structure?
•	To organize data 
•	Storage of data 
•	Retrieval of data
•	Manipulation of data

##Advantages and Real Use of Data Structure In Domain Name Structure
•	DS allow into storage on hard disk
•	It manages large data
•	It is necessary for designing of efficient algorithm

##What is an Algorithm?
Algorithm is a set of instructions which leads to a step procedure for solving a given problem.

## What are the properties of Algorithm
1.	Input: Whatever instructions are entered by the programmers
2.	Output: Atleast one outcome will be produced
3.	Definiteness: Each instruction should be clear and unambiguous 
4.	Finiteness: Every algorithm with terminate after a certain number of steps and it is called finiteness. 
5.	Effectiveness: Every instruction must be sufficiently basic that it can in principle be carried out by a person using pencil and paper

##Classification of Data Structure
Linear DS: If elements or items are stored in sequence, it is called Linear Data Structure
Non-Linear DS: Not stored in sequence, elements, or items. Example: Tree, graphs, etc.
